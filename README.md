# Movie Recommendation System Project

A simple web application with Flask that using machine learning provides movie recommendations to users

## Features

-   Basic Authentication
-   Personalized Recommendation with Kernal Matrix Factorization method
-   Recommend movies with a similar plot by using the TF-IDF method
-   Visualization for the user to have a better insight about his/her rating
-   Simple searching function allows users to search movies

## Further improvement

My future goal is to research more into recommender system design and experiment with SOTA recommendation methods
